# PROJECT SUMMARY

Implementation of AI agent "travel planner" assignment for UDACITY "AGENTIC AI" Nanodegree - Module 1

# PROJECT DESCRIPTION

Let an AI agent powered by an OpenAI LLM prepare a detailed, day-by-day, travel schedule for a list of travelers
The input data (travelers' expectations, travel budget, travel dates) is used by OppenAI LLM to prepare an itinerary matching the travelers' situation.

# PROJECT STEPS

The first travel schedule proposal is generated by an LLM based on the Vacation details information. This is performed using Chain-Of-Thought prompting.
Then the app must revisit the initial schedule to incorporate the feedback of the traveler.
