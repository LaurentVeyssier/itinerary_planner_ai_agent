# PROJECT SUMMARY

Implementation of AI agent "travel planner" assignment for UDACITY "AGENTIC AI" Nanodegree - Module 1

# PROJECT DESCRIPTION

Let an AI agent prepare a detailed, day-by-day, travel schedule for a list of travelers.
The input data (travelers' expectations, travel budget, travel dates) is used by an OpenAI LLM to prepare an itinerary matching the travelers' expectations.

# PROJECT STEPS

- step 1: The first travel schedule proposal is generated by an LLM based on the Vacation details information. This is performed using Chain-Of-Thought prompting.

Then the app must revisit the initial schedule to incorporate the feedback of the traveler.

- step 2: The initial schedule is modified by a second AI agent to incorporate the feedback of the traveler.
This second agent operates using ReACT prompting (Think/Act/observation cycles).

# PROJECT STRUCTURE

- set up virtual environment using uv
- populate OpenAI API key in the .env file
- run the agents using main.py script in /src
- Mock-up data can be found in utils/data.py
